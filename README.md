ðŸšŒ Our mini project is about Bus Route Navigation using Graph Data Structure

Description:
    This project focuses on building an efficient Bus Route Navigation System using C programming and the Graph Data Structure. The system helps users find the shortest and most optimal path between two bus stops based on available routes and distances. By representing bus stops as nodes and routes as edges, the project leverages algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to compute optimal travel paths.

Dataset:
     Source: OpenStreetMap
     Contents: Bus stops, routes, and distance information

Goal (SDG 11 â€“ Sustainable Cities and Communities):
      This project contributes to SDG Goal 11, which aims to make cities more sustainable and efficient. By improving public transportation navigation, it promotes accessible, safe, and eco-friendly mobility solutions within urban environments.

Key Features:
     --Graph-based representation of bus routes
     --Shortest path calculation between any two stops
     --Dynamic addition or removal of bus routes/stops
     --Display of optimal routes with distance
     --Lightweight and efficient C implementation

Tech Stack:
     --Language: C
     --Concepts Used: Graphs, Adjacency Matrix/List, Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm, BFS

Outcome:
    An optimized bus route navigation tool that enhances public transport efficiency, reduces travel time, and supports sustainable urban development.
